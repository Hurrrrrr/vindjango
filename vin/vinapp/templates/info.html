                        NB: This version of Vindicate is deprecated. When I began working on it, generative AI had not reached the level of notoriety and availability that we see today. This algorithmic implementation of Vindicate remains here while an LLM-based implementation is being developed.

                        Vindicate helps you improve your wine knowledge in a fun, gamified way by trying to identify an unknown wine based on a tasting note. Customize the experience in two ways: by selecting the scope and by selecting the accuracy.

                    <p class="lead mb-4">
                        With a narrow scope, only the worldâ€™s most well-known and recognizable wine styles will appear. With a wide scope, anything goes: obscure regions, old bottles, and cutting-edge styles can all show up.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-4">
                        To make the experience more challenging, less repetitive, and to simulate the real-world experience of being an imperfect taster, choose a lower accuracy and Vindicate will procedurally generate tasting notes that are more likely to contain errors and those errors are more likely to be bigger.
