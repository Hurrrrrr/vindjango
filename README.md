# vindjango

Vindjango is the pre-launch name of Vindicate, an app that lets users improve
their wine knowledge by trying to identify an unknown wine based on a tasting
note. Users can select a narrow scope, with only the most well-known styles
available, to a wide scope where anything goes. To make the task more
challenging and simulate the real-world experience of being an imperfect
taster, Vindicate will procedurally generate tasting notes with a level
(in)accuracy chosen by the user, from perfect to horrible and everything
in between.

This is my first independent coding project. The logic was mostly written in
Python and became a webapp via Django. I did this because Javascript was
already my strongest language so I wanted to improve my Python skills and
learn Django. I've written this with the intent of being as readable as
possible with minimal comments, rather than favouring performance.

New-to-me technologies/skills which I learned for this project:
    software architecture design
    SQLite3/database management in Python
    Django
    prompt engineering
    data visualization with D3

Note: On a Raspberry Pi, numpy requires libatlas-base-dev
